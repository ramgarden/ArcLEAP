ArcLEAP

ArcGIS interface with the LEAP motion controller.

This is meant to be a class that you can implement in order to make ArcMap 
do things based on gestures without touching the computer.  This would be
helpful for field users that may have dirty hands or wearing protective
gloves making it hard to use a mouse, keyboard, or touch screen.
